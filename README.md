## Software Engineering Intern at JUYI Technology (June 2023 - August 2023)

### Background

JUYI Technology (https://www.365mrp.com/) is a software company that provides enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions. The company is headquartered in Shenzhen, Guangdong, China. 

In June 2023, their website had a deprecating front end and an outdated design. The front-end frameworks they were using were Vue 2 and Nuxt 2 (a Vue 2 framework). Vue 2 was reaching the end of life (EOL) in December 2023 (https://v2.vuejs.org/eol/) after which vulnerability risks will increase.

Thus, they needed to migrate the front end from Vue 2 and Nuxt 2 to Vue 3 and Nuxt 3 and revamp the user interface (UI) design to improve the user experience (UX). They only had one full-time software engineer doing the migration and revamping. He had to do it in 6 months while working on the company's ERP products. 

As an intern, I helped them achieve their goal in just 2 months, allowing the website to be deployed in August 2023, 4 months before Vue 2's EOL. With no prior experience in Vue and Nuxt, I quickly learned the basics of Vue 3 and Nuxt 3 in 1 month and made several impactful contributions to the codebase.
